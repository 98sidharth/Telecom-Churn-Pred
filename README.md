# Telecom-Churn-Pred
This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. The project is built using Python and various open source libraries, such as Scikit-learn and Pandas. 

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. To achieve this, we use a dataset of telecom customer data that includes various features, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer service interactions. We preprocess the data to clean and transform it into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. Then, we train and test several machine learning models to determine which model is best suited for the task of predicting churn.
