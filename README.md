# Telecom-Churn-Pred
This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn in the telecom industry. The project is built using Python and various open source libraries, such as Scikit-learn and Pandas. 

Project Overview 

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. To achieve this, we use a dataset of telecom customer data that includes various features, such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer service interactions. We preprocess the data to clean and transform it into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms. Then, we train and test several machine learning models to determine which model is best suited for the task of predicting churn.

In this repository, I have performed the end to end Exploratory Data Analysis, and idenfitied the characteristics of the customers that are more likely to churn, and I have used them wisely to create a model, and lately, have deployed the model.
